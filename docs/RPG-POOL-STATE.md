# Subjective RPG + pool — system state and open joints

**Read this before touching the RPG or the pool primitive.** It exists so a session
*executes* the joints below rather than re-designing them. The joints are **decided,
not open for re-design.** If you find yourself about to write a new proposal, or to
rebuild the architecture from scratch — **stop**: the canon is `rpg-architecture-subjective`
(§2); the older objective `rpg-architecture` is a superseded draft, not a design gap. The
discipline this whole effort defends: *maximise pscale block + bsp + LLM; do not
multiply code.*

## 1. What is LIVE and PROVEN (the runtime)

- **Pool accumulates past 9 by supernest** — `src/accumulator.ts` (`appendWithSupernest`); `pool_engage` wired; envelope hint comes from the pool's underscore. PR #63, **deployed** (Railway → `bsp.hermitcrab.me`). Proven by smoke (accumulator 22/22, pool-engage 34/34) and live for a single contribution; **past-9 not yet exercised live** (§3 Joint C).
- **Perception-as-depth** — proven live on `spatial:thornwood:111`: the secret ("the stillness is listening") sits at `111*1.31`, occluded at a newcomer's depth (`111*1` `P=-1`), revealed at `P=-2`. Occlusion **is** read-depth; the mechanism is real (the substrate returns whatever `P` is asked — *entitlement* is convention, hardenable via `sed:`/locks).
- **`function:thornwood:1`** is a faithful **subjective soft directive**, live. The pool's underscore points the soft to it.
- **`accumulator.ts`** is a reusable geometry helper — `marks` and `history` can adopt the same `appendWithSupernest` call.

## 2. RESOLVED — canon is `rpg-architecture-subjective` (Weft's)

The canonical RPG constitution is **`rpg-architecture-subjective`** on the beach —
Weft-authored, branches 1–9, citing the live proof, locked under Weft's own passphrase.
A fresh session reads **that** block for the architecture, and the runtime
(`function:thornwood`, `frame-spec:thornwood` v0.2, the conformed room) already agrees
with it.

The older **`rpg-architecture`** block is happyseaurchin's earlier OBJECTIVE draft (one
shared `solid:`, `visible_to`). It is **superseded, not promoted** — left in place,
untouched, ignored. No promotion step, no shared lock to wait on: canon and runtime
already say the same thing. **Closed.**

## 3. The open joints — DECIDED, spec'd. Execute; do not re-open.

### Joint A — the resolution leg (the loop's last joint)
*Symptom (parallel test):* a committed intention has no path back to a spine — turn 2
can't read its own outcome. `solid:beaten-drum-main` still exists; the medium→spine
write lives in `nomad-bsp` crab code, not operational on the beach.
*Decided:* the medium (crab) reads the window, resolves, and writes each character's
outcome into **that character's own spine** (`witnessed:<handle>`) — never a shared
`solid:`. Then **retire `solid:beaten-drum-main` + `visible_to`**, and align
`function:thornwood:2,3` to subjective. Coupled: soft-reads-spine requires
medium-writes-spine, so these land together.
*Do not:* run the crab's **consolidation** until conformed — its current fold
re-pollutes the room that was cleaned (`spatial:thornwood:111`).

### Joint B — the cross-spine clock (next thing that breaks under real play)
*Symptom (parallel test):* `witnessed:cyrus` already holds post-revelation knowledge
while the stage's public surface shows the pre-approach moment. That spine≠stage gap is
correct — but with **no tick on events**, a medium cannot order two characters' spines
against each other.
*Decided* (from the synthesis doc, was tagged `[word-model]`): each resolved beat
carries a `tick` (per-subject forward time + scene-round alignment); the medium
interleaves co-present spines by tick. Build it **with** Joint A — it is the same medium
pass, not a separate system.

### Joint C — past-9 supernest, live
Deployed and unit-proven, but only one live contribution posted. Post 9+ to a throwaway
pool on `bsp.hermitcrab.me` and confirm the 10th supernests in production (the original
nine stay intact, the 10th is a fresh `11`).

## 4. Path 3 (submit/commit) — spec. Note: **path 3 ≠ A.**

Path 3 is the **submit/commit build**; **A** is the decision *inside* it (what `commit`
does). So: "build path 3, with `commit` = A."

- **`submit`** → writes `liquid:pool:<name>` (per-author slot, overwriting, **no**
  synthesis returned).
- **`commit`** → writes `pool:<name>` (the resolution **chronicle**, supernest-
  accumulated, **with** the synthesis envelope). *This leg is A.*
- **RPG caveat:** the RPG's `commit`/resolution goes to **spines** (Joint A), *not* the
  pool chronicle. So **A for general pools; the RPG redirects the destination.** Same
  `submit`; only where `commit` lands differs — and that difference is the
  objective/subjective line.
- **bsp-mcp side (do this first):** `pool_engage` gains `submit`/`commit` params + the
  `liquid:` block. A pool's directive lives **external** (`function:<game>/1`); the
  pool's underscore points at it via a `*ref` the envelope follows — pure-liquid and
  supernest-safe (a digit position can't hold a hint; slot 9 is an entry).
- Then `block-conventions:4.2` doc, then the xstream pool flow.
- **This is a fresh-session build.** Do not start it at a filling context window.

## 5. Ownership (David assigns; the work is spec'd so it transfers cleanly)

- **Constitution (§2)** — closed; canon is `rpg-architecture-subjective` (Weft's). No promotion, no lock step.
- **Path 3 / pool primitive (§4)** — the pool-behaviour session.
- **Resolution leg + clock (Joints A, B)** — the RPG-medium build (the `nomad-bsp` crab).
- **`block-conventions:9` + `4.2`** accumulator-shape update — with whoever does §4.

## 6. The design records

- `proposals/2026-06-03-supernest-floor-growth-and-positional-ladder.md` — on disk; the supernest spec implemented in `accumulator.ts`.
- The four `proposals/2026-06-02-*.md` RPG docs (the grounded synthesis + its two superseded predecessors, the xstream-extension scope) were authored this session but **lost to concurrent branch churn before being committed**. Their essence is consolidated into this state doc; the full synthesis is recoverable from the 2026-06-03 session transcript if the detail is wanted. **Lesson: untracked docs do not survive the multi-session branch switching this repo currently sees — commit on creation.**
- **Authorship:** the subjective RPG design — `rpg-architecture-subjective`, the spine / perception-as-depth / manifest model, the proven authoring law — is **Weft's**; happyseaurchin's role was direction, not authorship of the constitution.

## 7. Deploy fact (verified 2026-06-04)

The bsp-mcp **router** at `bsp.hermitcrab.me` deploys via **Railway** (live headers: `server: railway-hikari`, `x-railway-edge`) — CLAUDE.md's "Storage" section is correct; do not change it to Vercel. The **Vercel** deployment is the **beach** (`beach.happyseaurchin.com`), a separate service. Router = Railway, beach = Vercel; earlier notes conflated the two.
